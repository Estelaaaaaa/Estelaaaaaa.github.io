    </div>
    <div class="i">
        <p>Music is a collection of coordinated sounds. Making music is the process of arranging sounds and tones
            in order, often combining them to create a unique composition. People who make music creatively organize
            sounds
            for a desired result.
            Without music, expressing yourself would be very difficult. It serves as a way of expressing one's emotions
            and
            ulitimately connnecting with the audience. Music represents connection and empathy between people
            Also, music contributes much to culture through being enjoyable. Let's face it, music is interesting, so
            people
            listen to it! What makes it so enjoyable is that it can influence a person's thoughts and feelings about a
            certain topic with possibly√Ç changing their opinion. If not music, what else would give the world life?
            Almost
            everything in a person's daily life is accompanied by music. Consider how television would sound if music
            were
            gone. There wouldn't be theme songs for your favorite shows or catchy jingles for advertisements that stay
            stuck
            in your mind for days. Even a silent film wouldn't convince you to see it. Whether you agree with it or not,
            a
            movie's music encourages viewers to more freely express their emotions in sync with the dialogue on the
            screen.<br>
            Over the past two decades, music has been the subject of much neuroscientific and clinical research that has
            greatly advanced our understanding of its therapeutic potential. The authors analyze a number of
            neurobiological
            ideas that could explain music's potential and effectiveness withe treating psychiatric diseases, as well as
            a
            quick review of recent studies on the topic.<br>
            Music is able to influence complicated neurobiological processes in the brain, according to neuroscientific
            studies, and this suggests that it may be crucial for treatment. The use of music therapy as an alternative
            therapy for the treatment of depression, autism, schizophrenia, and dementia, as well as issues with
            agitation,
            anxiety, insomnia, and substance abuse, is suggested by several clinical trials, although it's not yet clear
            if
            it can completely replace other treatment options.

        <summary>How to learn music theory?</summary>
        <p>Basically, every piece of music consists of two basic things: pitch and rhythm. Learning how these concepts
            work
            and build upon themselves is essential for mastering the theory. The best music theory courses cover basic
            and
            advanced concepts and use simple language and helpful diagrams or audio examples to teach. Here are the top
            things you should expect in any music theory course material:
            <br>1) Pitch training (they explain topics such as scales, intervals, chords, inversions, keys, harmony,
            etc.)
            <br>2) Rhythmic training (duration, rhythmic structures and tempo, rhythmic symbols and values)
            <br>3) Composition (relying on both notes and rhythm, and combining them to create music)
            <br>4) Ear training (to be able to identify things like intervals, chord types, modulations and rhythm by
            ear, just by
            listening to them and not looking at notes)

        <summary>What is the most popular genre of music?</summary>
        <p>Last month, Spotify announced that they now have 75 million active users, which is almost double what they
            had a
            year ago. This research they conducted ties into a similar analysis recently done with the help of Last.fm,
            which also showed that hip hop is the most important music genre to emerge in the last 50 years.

        <summary>How is music produced?</summary>
        <br><br>
        <p>Music that is produced is usually electornic or "computer" music. It involves the application of computer
            technology in music composition, to help human composers create new music or to make computers create music
            independently. It includes the theory and application of new and existing computer software technologies and
            basic aspects of music, such as sound synthesis, digital signal processing, sound design, sound diffusion,
            acoustics and psychoacoustics. The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the time of the
            emergence
            of electronic music and the first experiments and innovations in the field of electronic instruments at the
            turn
            of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>

        <p>Sports have been an integral part of human civilization for centuries. From ancient times to modern times,
            people have indulged in various physical activities to keep their bodies fit and healthy. Sports are not
            only a source of entertainment but also promote physical fitness and mental well-being. Different types of
            sports cater to various interests and abilities, making them accessible to everyone.<br><br>

            One of the primary benefits of sports is physical fitness. Playing sports helps improve cardiovascular
            health, build muscle mass, and increase flexibility. Sports require players to engage in physical activity,
            which in turn releases endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. Moreover, sports help reduce the
            risk of developing chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.<br><br>

            Sports also provide a sense of community and social belonging. Whether playing for a team or attending a
            game as a spectator, sports bring people together, promoting camaraderie and friendship. Sports also help
            people develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership.<br><br>

            Finally, sports are an excellent source of entertainment. They provide an escape from the stresses of
            everyday life, allowing people to unwind and enjoy themselves. Sports have a universal appeal, transcending
            cultural and linguistic barriers. Whether it's football, basketball, or cricket, people around the world
            enjoy watching their favorite sports teams compete.<br><br>

            In conclusion, sports have numerous benefits, both physical and psychological. They provide an excellent way
            to maintain physical fitness, promote social bonding, and serve as a source of entertainment. Furthermore,
            sports teach important life skills, such as teamwork and communication, making them a vital part of human
            society.</p>

            <summary> Where was football invented?</summary>
            <p>Early signs of football as a sport appear in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. During the Han
                Dynasty,
                people found leather balls and hit them into a small net. The facts also show that both the Greeks and
                the
                Romans used the ball to pass especially for entertainment, while the Japanese in Kyoto already turned it
                into a
                kind of popular sport.
                <br>

                But the beginning of the emergence of modern football, as it is played today, allegedly began in
                England. An
                interesting fact is that at one point the ball used to pass each other was the head of a Danish bandit.
                But in
                the Middle Ages, the goal of this sport was to bring the ball to a certain point, while various
                activities such
                as hitting, pushing and the like were allowed. In a short period of time, people fell in love with such
                a way of
                playing that they spent the whole day on the field. Sometimes the competition became so fierce that the
                game was
                full of violence. Even the soldiers of the time were so amazed that they missed military exercises to
                watch
                football.

            <summary>What are the rules to volleyball?</summary>

            <p> Volleyball is an Olympic sport with a ball in which two opposing teams play on a field with a net
                stretched in
                the middle. The object of the game is to send the ball over the net to touch the opponent's court and
                prevent
                the opponent from doing the same. The team has the right to three plays (not counting the touch of the
                block),
                before returning the ball to the opponent.

                <br>
                <br>

                The ball is put into play by service: the serving player directs the ball over the net towards the
                opponent. The
                game continues until the ball touches the field, goes out of the field (out), and if the team fails to
                return it
                in the permitted manner. The team that wins the rally wins a point (Rally Point System). When the team
                receiving
                the serve wins the rally, it wins a point, and thus acquires the right to serve, and the players rotate
                one
                place clockwise.

                <br>

                A point is scored when a successfully sent ball touches the opponent's field, when the opposing team
                makes a
                mistake and when the opposing team receives a penalty. Rallying is a series of actions in the game from
                the
                moment of the service shot by the server to the moment when the ball is out of play.
                The serving team wins the rally wins the point and continues to serve, and if the team receiving the
                serve wins
                the rally, wins the point and must serve next.

                <br>

                The winner of the match is the team that wins three sets, and in the case of a tied score of 2-2, the
                decisive
                fifth set is played to 15 points with a difference of at least two points.

            <summary>How do I build muscle mass?</summary>
            <br><br>
            <p> When it comes to how to increase muscle mass, at the beginning we will reveal to you that the principle
                of
                gaining mass is not complicated, but that it is very important that you are persistent, disciplined and
                that you
                need to invest effort and energy in achieving results. Every professional athlete knows that visible
                results in
                the gym require a lot of effort, but that the greatest effects are often the result of basic intensive
                exercises
                and adequate nutrition that complements your exercise regimen. The same rule applies to gaining body
                mass.
                <br>
                <br>
                Three factors are important for increasing muscle mass:
                <br>
                <br>
                1) Intense training with load that promotes the growth of muscle mass <br>
                2) Proper nutrition to support muscle building <br>
                3) To have rest and recovery for the body and muscles after training <br>
                4) Building mass and gaining weight in the case of nutrition refers to a higher intake of calories, but
                primarily <br>
                quality calories from nutritious foods that are responsible for building muscle mass. When we talk about
                <br>
                building muscle, it is necessary to adjust the diet to build lean muscle mass, because you do not want
                to end up
                <br>
                with excessive accumulation of fat deposits.
                <br>
                <br>
                A high-calorie diet includes the following:
                <br>
                <br>
                1) Proteins, which are the basic builders in the body <br>
                2) Carbohydrates as drivers of energy <br>
                3) Unsaturated fats that provide energy and have a positive effect on the body <br>
                4) When it comes to how to increase muscle mass, it is primarily necessary to do activities that the
                muscles are
                <br>
                not used to, that is, to add weight and load in order to activate muscle growth. The number of
                repetitions is
                <br>
                important for muscular endurance, but after a while when your muscles get used to the current weight you
                need to
                <br>
                challenge the muscles more because that is the only way to build them. The most important thing is that
                you <br>
                reach the point with the exercises that is considered muscle failure, when you can no longer bear the
                weight in
                <br>
                the correct form, and calculate that you need 6-10 repetitions for this. Then muscle growth occurs. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Another important factor in the successful increase of muscle mass and weight gain is to give the body
                rest and
                recovery with enough hours of sleep. In this way, you prepare your muscles for the next workout, and
                since
                training is also a type of stress for your body, it is necessary for it to fully recover. It is
                desirable that
                you expose yourself as little as possible to stress and the activation of the growth of cortisol, a
                stress
                hormone that can stimulate catabolism (muscle breakdown).

    <p>Art is a form of expression that has been a part of human culture since the beginning of time. It encompasses a
        wide range of activities, including painting, sculpture, music, literature, dance, theater, and film. Art is an
        essential aspect of human experience and plays a significant role in shaping our society and culture.<br><br>

        One of the most significant benefits of art is its ability to bring people together. Art is a universal language
        that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers. It has the power to connect people from different backgrounds
        and create a sense of unity and understanding. Art can also be used to communicate important social and
        political messages and to raise awareness about important issues.<br><br>

        Another important aspect of art is its ability to stimulate creativity and imagination. Through art, individuals
        can explore their innermost thoughts and emotions and express them in unique and creative ways. Art also
        provides a platform for experimentation, allowing individuals to try new things and push the boundaries of what
        is possible.<br><br>

        Finally, art is essential to our personal and cultural growth. It allows us to reflect on our experiences and
        emotions and to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. Art also helps us to
        appreciate the beauty and diversity of our world and to recognize the unique contributions that each individual
        can make to society.<br><br>

        In conclusion, art is an essential aspect of human experience that plays a significant role in shaping our
        society and culture. It brings people together, stimulates creativity and imagination, and is essential to our
        personal and cultural growth. As we continue to explore the world around us and push the boundaries of what is
        possible, art will continue to be a vital part of our lives. </p>

        <summary>Why did Van Gogh cut off his ear?</summary>
        <p>The first theory<br><br>
            Historians state that the trigger for such a decision was most likely the news that his brother had become
            engaged. According to one study, Van Gogh learned this news on the very day he cut off his ear, December 23,
            1888. Experts believe that this knowledge surprised and frightened Van Gogh that he would remain forever
            alone,
            without money, that is, without the financial support of his brother, who enabled him to live the life he
            led.
            The news upset him greatly and caused him to commit self-harm. His brother's marriage may not have been the
            key
            reason, but it did initiate and reinforce his otherwise destructive behavior.<br><br>
            Another theory<br><br>
            The next theory about Vincent van Gogh's ear, according to some sources, begins on this day in 1888, when
            van
            Gogh was in the company of his friend, the French artist Paul Gauguin. They got into a big argument, and as
            a
            result of this argument, in order to prove some of his claims, van Gogh cut off his ear. After that, he went
            to
            a nearby brothel where he gave a girl his severed ear wrapped in a cloth and asked her to look after him.
            The
            girl fainted from the shock, and Van Gogh returned home and went to sleep. When the police arrived, he
            admitted
            that he had cut off his own ear and that it was his own fault.

        <summary>What are performing arts?</summary>
        <p>Performance has become one of the key terms of the new century. Traditionally, this term is associated with
            artistic practices that have adopted certain theatrical and ceremonial techniques and approaches.
            Performance
            practice was deconstructed by artists, from the second half of the 20th century onwards, who were interested
            in
            breaking down theatrical and artistic rules. They devised new ways of shocking the audience based on a live
            and
            direct approach, as well as a unique, one-time presentation of works of art. The uniqueness of the work and
            the
            direct relationship with the audience were crucial for the first generation of new performance artists.<br>
            Today it is better to use the term "performance art" instead of "performance art". The reason for this is
            that,
            in a narrower sense, the strict meaning of performance has been replaced with multidimensional, hybrid ways
            of
            understanding and practicing this genre. Such a redefinition was achieved primarily thanks to the transmedia
            way
            of working, the one that connected the original meaning of the performance with other technologies and media
            and
            resulted from a direct relationship with the audience. On the other hand, , the concept gained importance
            partly
            thanks to the proliferation and expansion of the concept of "performativeness", which emphasized questions
            related to the mediation and spheres of art, rather than the question of theatricality itself.

    <p>Gaming has become an increasingly popular pastime in recent years, with people of all ages and backgrounds
        embracing the world of gaming. From consoles to mobile devices, there are now more ways than ever to play video
        games. Many people enjoy gaming as a way to relax and unwind after a long day, while others see it as a
        competitive sport or a way to connect with others.<br> <br>

        One of the most appealing aspects of gaming is the immersive and interactive nature of the experience. Games
        allow players to step into new worlds and take on new roles, from solving puzzles and battling monsters to
        exploring vast open worlds and building their own virtual empires. This level of interactivity is a key part of
        what makes gaming so engaging and addictive for many people.
        <br> <br>
        Another advantage of gaming is the social aspect it offers. Multiplayer games allow players to connect with
        others around the world and form communities around shared interests. Online gaming has also opened up new
        opportunities for esports, where professional gamers compete for cash prizes and recognition.
        <br> <br>
        Despite the many benefits of gaming, it is important to remember that like any form of entertainment, it can
        have negative effects if not used in moderation. Some people may become addicted to gaming and neglect other
        important areas of their lives, such as work or relationships. It is important to find a healthy balance and use
        gaming as a fun and rewarding way to unwind, connect with others, and explore new worlds.

            pillowcases, curtains, aprons, trouser hems, anything that requires minimal tailoring and includes simple
            straight seams, or hemming. When you "get to know" your sewing machine, and gain the first skills and
            confidence, you can start on more complicated projects, which include more complex tailoring and
            sewing.<br><br>

            As for tailoring, it can be said that it is another separate skill, which you will have to master (with the
            help
            of books, tutorials).<br><br>

            Before you decide to buy a few meters of expensive delicate material and sew a formal dress, we recommend
            that
            you get a garment made of the same or similar material in a second-hand store, and try to remake that
            garment to
            a certain extent. In this way, you will learn how certain materials behave, and reduce the possibility of
            mistakes, which you will not be able to correct on a new, expensive material.
